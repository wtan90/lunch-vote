## Project set up
Create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for a project named "LunchVote". 
It needs a simple form where users can add places for lunch breaks. Each place
gets displayed in a list, and team members can vote on their preferred choice. 
It should have a modern and exciting design.

## Add places to Firebase, display them, and let users vote
I'm building an app called "LunchVote" to add lunch places, display them, and 
allow users to vote.

Store each lunch place in Firebase. Users cast a vote by clicking on a lunch place. 
Vote counts should be updated in real-time using Firebase's Realtime Database.

Use my Firebase configuration and existing project code as a reference to get started:

```
```

Please add detailed comments to the new code to help me understand it.

## Allow only 1 vote
Add the code to allow a user only to vote once. Users should also be able to change their vote.

## Delete poll
Add a "Delete poll" button at the bottom, which clears the database and resets the poll. Display the delete button only after a poll gets created.
